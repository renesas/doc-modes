1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates the typical use of the DOC HAL module APIs. The project performs the
	different event operations selected by the user in configurator properties. One of the following events
	can be selected: Compare Match, Compare Mismatch, Addition Overflow, or Subtraction Underflow. Upon success
	or failure of operation, the result will be displayed on the terminal. LED will turn ON only if the selected
	event operation is success and stays OFF if the operation fails.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA2A1, EK-RA2A2, EK-RA2E1, EK-RA2E2, EK-RA2L1, EK-RA2L2, EK-RA4C1, EK-RA4E2, EK-RA4L1,
	                     EK-RA4M1, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA4W1, EK-RA6E2, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G,
	                     EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8D2, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8M2, EK-RA8P1, FPB-RA2E3,
	                     FPB-RA2T1, FPB-RA4E1, FPB-RA6E1, FPB-RA8E1, MCK-RA4T1, MCK-RA6T2, MCK-RA6T3, MCK-RA8T1,
	                     MCK-RA8T2, RSSK-RA6T1, FPB-RA4E2, FPB-RA6E2.
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x USB cable for programming and debugging (USB cable type varies by board model).

3. Hardware Connections:
	Connect the RA board USB debug port to the host PC using the appropriate USB cable for EP programming and
	debugging.

	For FPB-RA2T1:
		The user must Close E8, E15 and Cut E10 to use P213 for LED1.

	For EK-RA4C1:
		The user must place jumper J6 on pins 2-3, J8 on pins 1-2, J9 on pins 2-3 and turn OFF SW4-4 to use
		the on-board debug functionality.

	For EK-RA8M2:
		The user must place jumper J6 on pins 2-3, J8 on pins 1-2, J9 on pins 2-3, and J29 on pins 1-2, 3-4,
		5-6, 7-8 to use the on-board debug functionality.

	For FPB-RA2E3:
		The user must close E25, E28, E46, E47 to use J-Link OB VCOM for serial terminal (UART).

Note:
1) Refer to R30AN0384 for example of advanced usage of DOC with other modules.

2) To view output logs on a serial terminal application (e.g., Tera Term), configure the settings as shown below:
	a. To make sure the received data shows properly, the user needs to set:
		[Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> [New-line] -> Select [Receive: CR] & [Transmit: CR].

	b. To echo back characters typed in Tera Term, the user needs to enable it through:
		[Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> Check [Local echo].

	c. The configuration parameters of the serial port on the serial terminal application:
		Port: The port is provided by the J-Link On-Board.
		Speed: 115200
		Data: 8 bit
		Parity: none
		Stop bits: 1 bit
		Flow control: none
